1. Implemented the first two chapters of the book: “The Code Book” by Simon Singh. 
2. Encrypted the text using substitution encrypt. To decrypt this text, mapped highest frequency letter of the text to “e” ( highest frequency letter in english) to        obtain the key to the encrypted text.
3. Encrypted the text from the book:  “The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle” using Vigenere Cypher, with a password.  
4. Calculated collision ratio (Rotated the text s by r places and compared s(0) with s(r) and calculated the proportion of collisions) until it peaked and a pattern was observed. 
5. Determined the length of the password by determining the number for which collision ration peaked. 
6. Partitioned the text into groups with respect to the password length and decrpted each group using substitution decrypt. Merged each group to get the final decrypted text.
