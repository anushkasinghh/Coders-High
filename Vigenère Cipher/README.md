Built a complicated encryption/decryption engine in Python based on the Vigenère cipher; (a polyalphabetic substitution cipher), as opposed to the Caesar Cipher ( a monoalphabetic substitution cipher). 
Encrypted, then decrypted the text from the book:  “The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle ''  using Vigenere Cypher
The fundamental operation is, like the Caesar Cipher, to "shift" a letter by some fixed shift-value, but in the Vigenere Cipher each symbol in the key is used as a different shift. If the key is as long as or longer than the plaintext message, each character of the plaintext message gets "caesar shifted" by a different value. Otherwise, we repeat the key over and over until we get something as long as the plaintext message
