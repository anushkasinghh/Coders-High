## Vigenere Cypher 
This is an implementation of the first two chapters of the book: "The Code Book" by Simon Singh. 
The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, based on the letters of a keyword (password). I have encrypted and decrypted the file sherlock.txt using this method. 

## Miller Rabin Test
The Miller–Rabin primality test or Rabin–Miller primality test is a probabilistic primality test: an algorithm which determines whether a given number is likely to be prime.

## Zero Knowledge Proof
In cryptography, a zero-knowledge proof or zero-knowledge protocol is a method by which one party can prove to another party that a given statement is true while the prover avoids conveying any additional information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true.
